Dear Player,

Welcome to "The Chrysalids"!

It's a real pleasure to meet you. I am Narrator X. I will be guiding you through the beginning of the game, and you will notice that I will say the exact same thing in the game as I will below. (Keep in mind that you are meant to figure out many parts of the game yourself, and I'm only telling you the basics!)

The story is told in your point of view. That is, you, whose name you will specify at the beginning, will be narrating the majority of this story. I will not tell you much about what this story is about, since a whole lot of surprises await you. However, these are some things that you should know as you're playing this game.

INSTRUCTIONS----------------------------------------------------------

This game comprises of two separate modes: namely, dialogue mode and action mode. In dialogue mode, you as the player simply have to press ENTER to read the next line.

In action mode, you will be prompted with the question, "What should I do?" This question is followed by a list of possible actions that you can take, such as "stay in class" or "hide under desk". You may choose an action to take by typing the action word-by-word. For instance, if "stay in class" is one of the actions that you can take, you can choose to do so by typing "stay in class" and pressing ENTER. If what you type is not a valid action (this includes typo!), you will be presented with an error message accordingly.

Among the actions is a special action that will often appear on the list of possible actions you can take, which is "go to". This action will move you to another location. Call this action by typing "go to <location>", which will move you to that specific location, if it's possible. (You must specify the <location> argument.) Otherwise, you will be presented with a message that you can't go to the location you have specified.

Another special action that you will often see on the list is "look". This action will let you observe a specified nearby object or place. Call this action by typing "look <thing>". (Unlike "go to", you may just type "look", which will give you a list of objects and places that you can specify as <thing>.) The places listed are where you can "go to" (e.g. "go to hallway"). If the specified <thing> is invalid, you will be presented with a message that you can't look at the thing you have specified.

Whenever you're in action mode, you are free to use the commands "item" and "use", which will not be mentioned explicitly on the list of actions you can take. (Hint: These commands will come in handy!) The command "item" shows you a list of items that you currently possess. The command "use <item>" corresponds to an action in which you use the specified item. If you don't have the item you specify, or the item you want to use cannot be used at the time of your action, a corresponding error message will appear.

When in doubt, always try pressing ENTER. The only time when simply pressing ENTER gives you an error message is when you're prompted to take an action. ("What should I do?")

Finally, throughout the game, there are several unmentioned 'checkpoints' that you can spawn back from in the case that you reach GAME OVER. When you reach GAME OVER, you can type "retry", "restart", or "quit". Typing "retry" allows you to return to the last checkpoint. You will notice that you don't start from the very beginning of the game, if you had gone far enough in the game prior to reaching GAME OVER. Typing "restart", on the other hand, restarts the entire game, in which case all the checkpoints are disabled back. Typing "quit" allows you to quit the game. (This is similar to "restart".) If you beat the game, you can only type either "restart" or "quit".

----------------------------------------------------------------------

That's it for instructions! Don't worry if you forget all of this. You can always bring out these instructions by typing "help" when you're in action mode. Just remember that the only commands or actions that are not explicitly mentioned are "item", "use", and "help"!

Good luck!
