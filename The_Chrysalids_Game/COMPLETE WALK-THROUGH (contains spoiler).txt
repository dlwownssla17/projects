For the first count-down ("SYSTEM SHUTDOWN IN X SECONDS."), wait until you see "PROCEED...". Then, pressing ENTER several times will lead you to the next count-down.

(3) Let's unlock all the achievements!

* Unlocking each achievement shows you a one-time message that says "[[Unlocked "(achievement name)"!]]". Typing the "achievements" command in action mode shows you all the achievements you have unlocked so far. This is explicitly told once in a notice when you unlock the "Sky & Life" achievement. In that notice, you will also be told that there is a total of 10 achievements to unlock. However, this is a lie. In fact, there is a total of 11 achievements, the hidden last one being the "Beat the Special" achievement. Once you unlock all the achievements, you get to receive a one-time grand congratulations from Narrator X, along with a sincere appreciation from me for spending your precious time on this game.

	Typed "asdfg" followed by "ThE cAkE iS a LiE" while in front of Shady Gutzmann's house, and then looked at Cheesecake in Fresh Grocer.

4. The Stripper @ Night :
